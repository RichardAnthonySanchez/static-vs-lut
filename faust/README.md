# Faust DSP Implementations

This directory is for implementations using the [Faust functional DSP language](https://faust.grame.fr/).

## 🛠 Contribution Guidelines
- Provide the `.dsp` source file.
- If applicable, include instructions for compiling to specific formats (e.g., `faust2lv2`, `faust2vst`).
- Focus on the comparison between mathematical functions and table-based lookups.
